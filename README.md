## For Viewers 👀

If you are here to **view resources**:

1. Browse the folders corresponding to your course or topic.  
2. Check the `links.md` file in each folder for **extra resources** like videos, PDFs, and notes.  
3. If you want to contribute or suggest something, please **contact me via email** before adding content.

## For Contributors ✍️

If you are allowed to **add or modify resources**, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Do not post solutions for graded material** — IITM strictly prohibits sharing graded solutions.  
2. **Keep files organized** — ensure that files are placed in the correct folders with clear, descriptive names.  
3. **Do not delete resources** — only add or modify files in your assigned folders.  
4. **Update `links.md`** in the respective folder whenever you add new resources. Try to **follow the sample formatting** in `links.md`.
5. **git commit:** Please try to commit changes to only one course in single commit.
6. **Handling images**:  
   - For multiple images, either create a dedicated folder or combine them into a PDF before uploading.  
   

> ⚠️ These are not exhaustive; always aim to maintain clarity and organization.

## General Notes 📝
